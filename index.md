I'm a postdoctoral fellow at KAUST, Saudi Arabia, hosted by [Peter Richtarik](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~prichtar/). I did my PhD at Telecom ParisTech, France, under the supervision of [Pascal Bianchi](https://bianchi.wp.imt.fr/), [Walid Hachem](http://www-syscom.univ-mlv.fr/~whachem/) and [Jérémie Jakubowicz](http://www-public.tem-tsp.eu/~jakubowi/) in the S2A (Signal, Statistics and Learning) team. I work on stochastic approximation, optimization and machine learning. I received the Masters degrees in 2015 from ENSAE ParisTech, where I studied statistics, and from Paris XI University, where I studied advanced probability. Here is my CV ([english]({{site.baseurl}}{% link postdoc_en.pdf %}) or [french]({{site.baseurl}}{% link postdoc_fr.pdf %})).
